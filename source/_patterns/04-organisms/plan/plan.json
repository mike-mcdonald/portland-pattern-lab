As Portland and the region grow, however, there is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of people who drive alone to work remains the same as it is now (nearly 60 percent), traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>supporting the City&#39;s commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our transportation system</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move more reliably</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>creating great places</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active transportation modes is essential to preserving the City&#39;s livability and for the protection of the natural environment. Constructing significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is not a viable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land, encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts. Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>\n<p>The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City&#39;s 2035 Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region&#39;s 2040 Growth Concept by supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help grow and sustain the City&#39;s economic health by accommodating the needs of businesses and supporting Portland&#39;s role in the international economy.</p>\n<p><strong>The 2035 TSP includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and implementation of Portland&#39;s transportation system</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan that would accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Master street plans and modal plans</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street classifications</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"elements-of-the-tsp\">Elements of the TSP</h2>\n<p>The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP were adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan by City Council in 2016. The TSP was adopted concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover. Stage 3 Update will be adopted separately from the Comp Plan and Stages 1 and 2, then incorporated into one TSP document.</p>\n<p>The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City&#39;s Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about transportation system conditions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image2.png\" alt=\"Relation to Other Plans_updated 10_03_14.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"transportation-system-plan-updates\">Transportation System Plan Updates</h2>\n<p>In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at regular intervals. The first two updates in the mid-2000s were not intended to include new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of planning efforts.</p>\n<p>The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).</p>\n<p>The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to implement the City&#39;s Green Street Policy.</p>\n<p>Stage 1 TSP Update was a part of the City&#39;s Comprehensive Plan update process and a component of the state&#39;s Periodic Work Plan Task 4. It included Goals, Policies, Projects and Programs and a Financial Plan. It was adopted by City Council in June 2016.</p>\n<p>The Stage 2 TSP Update was a part of the City&#39;s Comprehensive Plan update and changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. Periodic Work Plan Task 5 was adopted by City Council in December 2016.</p>\n<p>TSP Stage 3 TSP Update is incorporating regional information, updating geographic policies and objectives, updating objectives, adding a few policies, changes to street classification for traffic, transit and emergency response, modal plans, and other changes as identified. There is also parallel staff process to reformat the document and create a new user friendly digital document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"regulatory-framework\">Regulatory Framework</h2>\n<p>The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.</p>\n<p>State of Oregon</p>\n<p><em>Statewide Planning Goals</em></p>\n<p>Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State&#39;s land use planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals. The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>\n<p><em>Transportation Planning Rule</em></p>\n<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>\n<p><em>Oregon Transportation Plan</em></p>\n<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State&#39;s TSP. Regional and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.</p>\n<p>Regional Metro</p>\n<p><em>Regional Transportation Plan</em></p>\n<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Focuses on the regional transportation system</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design classifications</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes a list of major system improvements</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes a funding plan</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of August 2017 Metro and regional partners are updating the RTP with a new RTP to be issued in 2018.</p>\n<p><em>Region 2040 Growth Concept</em></p>\n<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development, including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space protection. It also designates design types, such as central city, regional center, town center, and main street.</p>\n<p><em>Regional Transportation Functional Plan</em></p>\n<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>\n<p><em>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</em></p>\n<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in 1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>\n<p><em>Regional Framework Plan</em></p>\n<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>\n<p>City of Portland</p>\n<p><em>Comprehensive Plan</em></p>\n<p>Portland&#39;s 2035 Comprehensive Plan guides land use development and public facility investment decisions between now and 2035. This guidance is intended to help make Portland more prosperous, healthy, equitable and resilient.</p>\n<p>The Comprehensive Plan includes five elements that work together to accomplish this goal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Vision and Guiding Principles</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Goals and Policies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Comprehensive Plan Map</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>List of Significant Projects</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transportation policies, classifications and master street plans</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Within the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, there are nine Transportation goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Safety</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Multiple goals</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Great places</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Environmentally sustainable</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Equitable transportation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Positive health outcomes</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Opportunities for prosperity</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Cost effectiveness</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Airport futures</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Transportation related policies from the 2035 Comprehensive Plan (2015) are located in Chapter 9 (Transportation), Chapter 3 (Urban Design), Chapter 4 (Development) and Chapter 8 (Public Facilities). The TSP also includes additional sub-policies and geographic-specific policies and objectives.</p>\n<p>Chapter 9: Transportation (policies are grouped in these subject areas:)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Designing and planning</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Land use, development, and placemaking</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Streets as public spaces</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Modal Policies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Airport Futures</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>System Management</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transportation Demand Management</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Parking Management</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finance, Programs and Coordination</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 8: Public Facilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Funding</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Public Benefits</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Public Rights of Way</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Trails</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stormwater systems</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 3: Urban Form</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Citywide design and development</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Centers</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Corridors</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transit Station Areas</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>City Greenways</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Employment areas</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Pattern Areas</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 4: Development</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Design and Development of centers and corridors</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Designing with nature</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation also using Comprehensive Plan Chapter 2: Community Involvement for its public involvement policies.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 has seven goals and 41 policies.</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Community Involvement as a Partnership</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Social Justice and Equity</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Value Community Wisdom and Participation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transparency and Accountability</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Meaningful Participation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Accessible and Effective Participation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Strong Civic Infrastructure</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 2 policies are grouped in these major areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Partners in decision making</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Environmental justice</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Invest in education and training</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Community assessment</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transparency and accountability</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Community involvement program</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Process design and evaluation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Information design and development</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"seven-outcomes\">Seven Outcomes</h2>\n<p>Working with our partners at Metro, the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, and the Oregon Department of Transportation, with direction from the Portland Plan (2012), the Climate Action Plan (2010), Health Equity &amp; the Transportation System Plan Report (2012), and from the Comprehensive Plan Update, PBOT staff developed an outcome based approach to the TSP.</p>\n<p>These seven outcomes directed policy choices as well as informed the development of criteria for selecting and prioritizing TSP Projects and Programs.

      "content": "<h1 id=\"master-street-plans\">Master Street Plans</h1>\n<p>The purpose of the Master Street Plans is to increase the efficiency of the transportation system through increased street connectivity and a finer mesh of pedestrian and bikeways. A dense grid of streets helps spread local vehicle trips more evenly over the local street network and reduces congestion on the arterial system. Studies show that improved local street connectivity improves arterial system capacity by as much as 25 percent.</p>\n<p>Studies show that distance is one of the most important factors in mode choice. The lack of a dense grid of streets and pedestrian/bicycle connections results in out-of-direction travel that is particularly discouraging to potential pedestrians and bicyclists. The result is increased use of the automobile for trips to nearby (as the crow flies) destinations. Trips need to be relatively short and direct to encourage travel on foot or by bicycle.</p>\n<p>Good street connectivity improves emergency response times. Police, fire, and ambulance services can reach their destinations more quickly because there is less out-of-direction travel. Multiple access routes can reduce travel times and provide access options if one route is blocked.</p>\n<p>Good local street connections can reduce traffic volumes on other streets by spreading traffic over a denser network. With more intersections, traffic also moves more slowly because side street traffic and stop signs discourage drivers from speeding.</p>\n<p>As properties are subdivided and developed, access needs are met primarily through new streets. The City&#39;s local street network has grown over time, as outlying areas became more urbanized or older areas are redeveloped. In the past, development was not always required to address connections to adjacent areas as well as internal circulation. The result has been large areas of the City with poor connectivity, particularly in newer areas where the counties previously regulated development.</p>\n<p><strong>State Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Street connectivity must be part of transportation system plans (TSPs) and adopting Ordinances. The Oregon Administrative Rule for State Land Use Goal 12, Transportation, Section 660-012-0020, Elements of Transportation Systems Plans, requires:</p>\n<p>A road plan for a system of arterials and collectors and standards for the layout of local streets and other important non-collector street connections.... The standards for the layout of local streets shall provide for safe and convenient bike and pedestrian circulation necessary to carry out OAR 660-012-045(3)(b).</p>\n<p>The State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) states that the intent of the requirement is to provide guidance on the spacing of future extensions and connections along existing and future streets that are needed to provide reasonably direct routes for bicycle and pedestrian travel.\nThe rule referenced above goes on to state:</p>\n<p>On-site facilities shall be provided which accommodate safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access from within new subdivisions, multi-family developments, planned developments, shopping centers, and commercial districts to adjacent residential areas and transit stops, and to neighborhood activity centers within one-half mile of the development. Single-family residential developments shall generally include streets and accessways. Pedestrian circulation through parking lots should generally be provided in the form of accessways.</p>\n<p>The TPR also states that local jurisdictions should establish their own standards or criteria for providing streets and accessways consistent with the intent stated above. This may be accomplished through standards for spacing of streets or accessways, and standards for excessive out-of-direction travel. The TPR defines &#39;safe and convenient&#39; access as being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reasonably free from hazards</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Meeting the needs of cyclists and pedestrians, considering destination and length of trip</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Metro Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (RTFP), adopted in 2010 (Ordinance 10-1241B) and updated in 2012, requires jurisdictions to implement two types of street plans:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conceptual street plans that:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Map contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixed-use development</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Identify appropriate connections to adjacent areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Demonstrate opportunities to extend and connect to existing streets, provide direct public right-of-way routes, and limit the potential of cul-de-sac and other closed-end street designs</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A street map for new residential or mixed-use development that will require construction of a new street(s) that:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Responds to and expands on the conceptual street plan map</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Provides for street connections no further apart than 530 feet, except where prevented by barriers such as topography, railroads, freeways, pre-existing development, or water features where regulations do not allow construction of or prescribe different standards for streets</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Provides bicycle and/or pedestrian connections when full street connections are not possible, no further apart than 330 feet, except where prevented by barriers as noted above</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Limits the use of cul-de-sac or closed street systems</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes street cross-sections</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"areas-meeting-connectivity-requirements\">Areas meeting connectivity requirements</h2>\n<p>Many areas of Portland meet the RTP connectivity standards or are not required to have master street plans.

On January 20, 2003, City Council adopted amendments to the Central City Plan and updated the District&#39;s special design guidelines and the zoning code. At the same time, City Council changed the North Macadam District name to South Waterfront District (the District). By authority of the City Engineer under Title 17 City Code, the South Waterfront Street Plan, Criteria and Standards was amended in 2007 providing updated design criteria and standard details for the District&#39;s public rights-of-way. The 2009 document update amends the North District (the area south of Sheridan St and north of Gibbs St) rights-of-way alignment and standards to accommodate future light rail and property development, as well as expanded streetcar service and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The South Waterfront District of the Central City of Portland lies along the Willamette River and south of downtown. The district boundaries are the River, Interstate 5, the Marquam Bridge and SW Hamilton Court. Adopted City policy envisions this as a mixed-use neighborhood with significant residential development along the River and commercial development focused along transit corridors. With just over one mile of River frontage the District contains approximately 140 acres. Some land is developed or being developed and some land is vacant land or has redevelopment potential.</p>\n<p>The primary development constraint in the District is transportation access to and from regional highway and transit systems. The South Waterfront Plan of January 20, 2003 includes a vision, policies and an Urban Design Plan that promotes high density housing and commercial development with a full range of businesses that contribute to the region&#39;s job growth. The vision also includes frequent public connections to the river, limiting the size and amount of surface parking lots, and integrating development and services.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image8.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In 1998 the North Macadam District Street Design Standards and Criteria Plan: Transportation Report considered and analyzed South Waterfront&#39;s limited access and adjacency to I-5 and Ross Island Bridge ramps. The analysis included the three district portal intersections: River Parkway and Harbor Drive (north), Curry and Macadam (center) and Bancroft and Macadam (south). The analysis was based on the District&#39;s 20-year goals for accommodating 10,000 jobs and 3,000 housing units and a 30 percent mode split. The housing goal has since been increased to 5,000 units.</p>\n<p>Conclusions were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Bancroft and Macadam portal improvements would accommodate traffic growth and transit access at acceptable levels of service. South Waterfront (North Macadam District) became part of the Central City in 1988.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moving the central portal from Gibbs to Curry and improving the Curry and Macadam intersection would better accommodate traffic operation, growth and access from I-5 to the District.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As the District&#39;s growth nears 10,000 jobs and 5,000 housing units, portal access will degrade and as a result function at a marginally acceptable level.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>River Parkway and Harbor Drive would operate at acceptable levels although backups on I-5 and Naito Parkway could interfere with operations on a more frequent basis in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 1998 transportation analysis demonstrated that while the District will experience increased congestion over time, the portal capacity with the identified portal improvements and increased transit service should continue to provide acceptable levels of service to the District and the regional transportation system.</p>\n<p>Since the 1998 report, plans for portal improvements have been altered. Through the South Portal Study, conducted in 2006, the recommended south portal shifted south to Hamilton St and Macadam. In addition, the planned central portal improvements at Curry have been scaled back and north portal improvements at River Parkway and Harbor Drive have been added. In fact, in 2009 the Portland Bureau of Transportation updated the technical analysis through the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy (resolution no. 36696 adopted April 8, 2009). The report identified multi-modal project priorities and a funding strategy to guide project implementation necessary to support continued development of the urban renewal area, including portal improvements.</p>\n<p>The 2007 update of the South Waterfront District Street Plan, Criteria and Standards primarily responded to development in the Central District and completion of infrastructure projects, including the Portland Streetcar extension to Lowell St and the Portland Aerial Tram to Oregon Health Sciences University. Transportation studies, such as the 2004 South Waterfront District Transportation Improvements Evaluation and 2006 South Portal Study had also been completed. Major updates included changes to the street lighting design standards, certain street furniture standards, and the modification of the street plan based on the recommendations of the South Portal Study and the new Greenstreet Policy (Resolution no. 36500 adopted in April of 2007). Other changes included modest refinements to various street dimensional standards developed through preliminary engineering and construction of these streets and to refinements of various performance criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>South Waterfront 2009 Update</strong></p>\n<p>Since the 2007 update, the City of Portland has endorsed the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) for the Portland to Milwaukie Light Rail alignment. This alignment extended light rail south into the North District and included bus service and streetcar utilizing the same alignment. In addition, the OHSU Schnitzer Campus master plan and the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy report, with a prioritized list of multi-modal projects and a funding strategy, have been completed. These activities generated the need to refine and update various elements of the Street Plan. Major updates include changes to the street alignments and designations in the Concept Street Plan Map, updates of some street widths in the Right-of-Way Width Map changes to street descriptions in the Street Classification and Function Table, and adjustments to the Standard Street Sections.</p>\n<p>Specific changes made to the Concept Street Plan map are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Bond Ave extends north through the District.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Bond Ave is one-way northbound through the District.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moody Ave is one-way southbound for vehicular traffic through the District; and one-way southbound for streetcar south of Woods St.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moody Ave remains two-way streetcar north of Woods St.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moody Ave includes a two-way bike path along the west-side to minimize bike/streetcar interactions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The grades of Moody Ave and Porter St are raised to a level consistent with the Willamette River Crossing Partnership findings necessary for light rail.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Porter St carries light rail, streetcar and bus in two directions only; private vehicles are not accommodated on this street.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>River Pkwy (south of the Marquam Bridge) terminates at Woods St.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Alignments are adjusted for local east-west streets north of Gibbs St.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>&quot;Special Design Area&quot; beneath the Ross Island Bridge has been relocated to reflect the location of the potential active-use park. Grover St is aligned on either side of the Ross Island Bridge.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"gateway-regional-center-street-plan\">Gateway Regional Center Street Plan</h4>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The 2040 Growth Concept identifies the Gateway regional center as the only regional center in Portland. Planning for Gateway began with the Outer Southeast Community Plan and continued with the Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy. City Council accepted Opportunity Gateway in February 2000 (Resolution No. 35867). The Outer Southeast Community Plan resulted in a plan district and transit-supportive zoning</p>\n<p>The Central Gateway portion of the Gateway District Master Street Plan was amended in 2009. This amendment was based on a recommendation in the Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy, which was adopted by the Portland Development Commission in August 2007. The Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy concluded that the street plan for Central Gateway should be updated, with the goal of increasing connectivity in Central Gateway, providing greater certainty to developers about street requirements and opening up parcels to redevelopment.</p>\n<p><strong>Street Connectivity</strong></p>\n<p>A discontinuous network of streets and sidewalks, high volumes of through-traffic, and underutilized property characterize Gateway regional center. Access to the transit stations in Gateway&#39;s northwest corner and at 102^nd^ and Burnside is problematic. Discontinuous streets discourage walking and bicycling, resulting in significant out-of-direction travel for all modes.</p>\n<p>Increasing street connectivity would disperse trips among many alternate routes, thereby reducing congestion, shortening trip lengths, and increasing the mode split for alternatives to the automobile.</p>\n<p><strong>Concept Plan Map</strong></p>\n<p>The Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy is intended to serve as the &#39;appropriate vision&#39; for the redevelopment of Gateway as a regional center. The concept plan map is a picture of the regional center&#39;s redevelopment potential and build-out in 2019. While the plan map affixes buildings and parks to specific locations, the reality is that new construction will appear somewhat differently. While new streets and connections are identified, they are also subject to change to respond to development opportunities. The Opportunity Gateway report states: &quot;It is rigid enough to be a statement of what is and is not desirable in the Regional Center, and flexible enough to be useful even as redevelopment circumstances change.&quot; The map graphically depicts the vision described in the report.</p>\n<p>The concept plan map calls for a traditional block configuration, which will help unify the regional center&#39;s character. Some of the proposed new connections would greatly change existing circulation patterns. Northeast Multnomah between Fred Meyer&#39;s and Mervyn&#39;s at the Gateway Shopping Center is shown as a fully functional street, intended to help disperse traffic associated with the transit center. In the southern part of the regional center, several new public streets are shown in the Mall 205 and Plaza 205 properties, breaking up what are now large expanses of parking. Pedestrian pathways connect important routes and destinations where full streets are not possible or appropriate, such as between SE 105^th^ and the Adventist Medical Center.</p>\n<p>As the major north-south arterial, 102^nd^ Avenue is the spine of the district and is targeted for improvements for all modes. Changes to 99^th^ Avenue would allow it to act as an additional north-south carrier, improving access for development projects and creating a new local identity the length of the district. Major east-west streets (Stark/Washington, Halsey/Weidler, Burnside, and Glisan) will continue to carry significant volumes of through-traffic. Better local north-south street connections will link the two main large shopping areas together, and improved connectivity will be provided within each of these shopping areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Central Gateway Street Plan 2009</strong></p>\n<p>The Central Gateway Master Street Plan revision was developed to provide flexibility for connections while maintaining larger parcels for redevelopment, recognizing existing parcel lines, provide connections on the local network without altering the district or neighborhood collectors and to foster redevelopment in the City&#39;s only Regional Center. Criteria were established for consideration in the proposed plan. Other goals of the plan included aligning streets on parcel boundaries for shared investment in right-of-way improvements; consider common or multiple parcel ownership; minimize parcel impacts and maintain reminder parcels; preserve some large parcels or contiguous ownership parcels; discourage cut-through traffic while providing access; discourage off-set intersections; consider potential spacing of crosswalks or signals.</p>\n<p>With these criteria and goals, a revised street plan for Central Gateway was developed. The revised street plan provided needed multi-modal connections within the Central Gateway area without changing the function of the major traffic streets and collectors surrounding the area, such as 102nd Ave., Glisan, Burnside, and Stark.</p>\n<p>Characteristics of the revised street plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>East-west connections between 97th Ave. and 102nd Ave. on Flanders St. and Davis St. North-south connection on 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Burnside and also between Oregon St. and Pacific St.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>North--south connection on 101st Ave. between Stark St. and approximately Flanders St., improving multi-modal access to the light-rail station on 102nd and Burnside.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Internal connection on Oregon St. approximately Hoyt St., Coach St., and 101st Ave.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Vacating portions of 97th Ave. to allow developable parcels near I-205. This would continue to allow multi-modal access to the parcels.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Maintaining existing large parcels for development and redevelopment while also providing public bicycle and pedestrian access ways. Large parcels would have the option to have public bike and pedestrian access ways on the site rather than full streets, as was required in the prior master street plan. Public bike and pedestrian access ways will be required on certain blocks such that spacing of public connections shall be no more than 330 feet where full street connections are more than 530 feet. Additionally, pedestrian connections would be required throughout Central Gateway.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because large parcels were maintained for development and redevelopment, the revised street plan does not include some of the proposed streets that were in the previous in the street plan for the Gateway District. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Extension of Oregon St. between 97th Ave. and 98th Ave. However, the revised street plan proposes to keep the Irving St. alignment as existing between 97th Ave. and 100th Ave., whereas the prior plan showed this segment as vacated.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Full street connection of Hoyt St. between 97th Ave. and 104th Ave.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Full street connection of roughly the Davis St. alignment between 97th Ave. and 103rd Ave. The revised street plan proposes that some portions of the alignment would be full street while other portions would be pedestrian connection.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Extension of 101st Ave. between Washington St. and Pacific St. The revised street plan proposes a mix of full streets and pedestrian connections on some portions of the 101st Ave. alignment. Other portions of the alignment would not have connections. Unlike as in the prior plan, the revised street plan does not intend for 101st Ave. to become a neighborhood collector. Rather, 99th Ave. would be a through street, with 100th Ave. also providing significant connectivity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Extension of 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Washington St. The revised street plan does not include any connectivity at this location. Vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles could access the area from connections at 97th Ave., and 101st.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image14.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"cully-neighborhood-local-street-plan-2012\">Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan (2012)</h4>\n<p>The Cully Commercial Corridor and Local Street Plan was adopted by Resolution 36952 in August 2012. Its development was funded by a Transportation Growth Management Grant from the Oregon Department of Transportation. Its recommendations were also influenced by the Portland Plan (April 2012) which had recommendations related to alternative right-of-way improvements, developing new options for unimproved rights-of-way and accelerating the creation of safe pedestrian connections. The Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan identified new street or pedestrian/bicycle connections to improve street connectivity and address gaps in transportation networks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"river-district-master-street-plan\">River District Master Street Plan</h4>\n<p>Revisions to the River District Master Street Plan were adopted by City Council on May 24^th^ 2018.</p>\n<h6 id=\"\"><img src=\"/img/media/image12.jpg\" alt=\"\"></h6>\n<h4 id=\"southwest-and-far-southeast\">Southwest and Far Southeast</h4>\n<p>The City completed master street plans for the Southwest and Far Southeast transportation districts in June 2001.

The SW and Far SE Master Street Plan -- Final Report and Recommendations contains quarter-section level maps and tables that detail the recommended connections. The report identifies three objectives to be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reduce the uncertainty in the development review process regarding when and where new street connections will be an issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Provide for better coordination of the local street system development.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Comply with the mandates of the State Transportation Planning Rule and Regional Transportation Plan for street connectivity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Southwest and Far Southeast master street plans were developed through a number of steps, with mapping associated with each step:</p>\n<p><em>Step One</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Define blocks in the study area that meet the spacing standard.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Define areas being excluded (areas where streets are complete or underway; parcels zoned as park, open space, or industrial; religious or educational institutions).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Step Two</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Define remaining areas that have development or redevelopment potential (land value greater than improvement value; different Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations; two-acre or larger parcels).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Define development constraints (street spacing not met, but parcels don&#39;t meet development potential).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Step Three</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define blocks with barriers to connectivity (environmentally constrained).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Step Four</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group the remaining areas into focus areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Step Five</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Define locations of new connections.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Determine specificity of connections -- specific points or along a block face.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Apply type of connection -- street or pedestrian/bicycle.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plans&#39; recommendations include information about the location, level of alignment specificity, type of connection, barriers, presence of environmental zones, traffic impacts, field notes, and comments from the public or technical staff.</p>\n<p>While the master street plans identify a number of future connections, the absence of a connection does not mean a connection is not needed or feasible. All areas within the study areas are still subject to relevant policy and spacing standards.</p>\n<h5 id=\"far-southeast-portland-master-street-plans\">Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plans</h5>\n<p><strong>Study Area</strong></p>\n<p>The Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plan includes nearly all of the Far Southeast Transportation District, from I-205 east to the City limit, and from Burnside south to the City limits. Some portions of this area are excluded from the plan: the Gateway regional center because a street plan already exists, and Burnside light rail station areas (102^nd^ to 162^nd^, NE Glisan to SE Stark), where master street plans will be completed as part of TSP refinement plans.</p>\n<p><em>Land Use</em></p>\n<p>The Far Southeast is predominantly in residential use, with interspersed commercial/retail uses. Commercial/retail uses are located in strip commercial development along arterials such as 122^nd^ and Division or in malls such as Mall 205 or the San Rafael Shopping Center. Institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, and schools, can create barriers, but offer limited opportunities for street connections. Cemeteries and parks also occupy significant tracts of land in the district. There are only a few pockets of industrial uses, principally near the Lents town center.</p>\n<p><em>Zoning</em></p>\n<p>The Far Southeast Master Street Plan Study area includes virtually all of the various City commercial zones, except some designed specifically for the Central City. The area includes nearly all the residential zones, excluding only the most dense zones. The employment and industrial zoning currently in place is confined primarily to the southern edge of the district. Significant tracts of open space zoning exist, with Powell Butte the largest. Environmental overlays are applied to areas with steep slopes and near streams and wetland areas, principally in the southeast portion of the district.</p>\n<p><em>Area Character</em></p>\n<p>Terrain and the density of development largely determine the area&#39;s character. Some less developed areas display a rural appearance, with open fields and large out-buildings. The majority of the district has a more suburban appearance, with large tracts of single-dwelling homes on medium to large lots. Some areas display a more urban character, with smaller lots and buildings closer to the street. Steep slopes with numerous streams and gullies are located in the southern portion of the area, along Johnson Creek and in Pleasant Valley.</p>\n<p>Long-term county stewardship, along with recent population growth, has resulted in relatively few public streets in some areas, and large redevelopable parcels of land. Many of the area&#39;s local service streets and collectors are not fully improved. The lack of sidewalks results in a street system that is not particularly pedestrian friendly. The lack of public streets contributes significantly to out-of-direction travel patterns, and very wide major arterials carry many local trips as well as through-trips.</p>\n<p><strong>Issues and Constraints</strong></p>\n<p>Barriers (such as terrain, streams, and existing development) will continue to limit a connected street system, including bicycle/pedestrian accessways, in Far Southeast Portland. With expected increases in the number of households and dwelling units in the area, however, completion of the local street system will be needed even more to provide multimodal access to areas of new development and from those areas to neighborhood activity centers, transit, and arterials.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image10.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h6 id=\"outer-powell-blvd-conceptual-plan-design-2012\">Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design (2012)</h6>\n<p>The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation, in coordination with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed a conceptual design plan for Outer SE Powell Blvd. from the I-205 to SE 174th Ave (city limits). This stretch of SE Powell Blvd is designated State Highway No. 26. Therefore, ODOT has jurisdiction along SE Powell Blvd.</p>\n<p>The plan addressed the needs for Outer Powell Blvd in a 20-year time frame. The plan identified improvements and right-of-way width needs that will allow Outer SE Powell Blvd to serve vehicle traffic movement while also improving the safety, accessibility and the aesthetic environment for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. The Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design was adopted by Resolution 36931 in February 2013.</p>\n<p>A component of the plan was improving local connectivity around Powell Blvd. A Local Streets and Access-ways Report identified additional connections in the area.</p>\n<p>Six types of connections were identified in the Local Streets and Accessways Report.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Separated In-Roadway Bicycle Facilities.</strong> Facilities that separate the bicycle travel lane from the motor vehicle lane with striping or a physical barrier. Examples are a standard bike lane, buffered bike lane, and cycle track.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bicycle Boulevards/Advisory Bike Lanes.</strong> Facilities on low traffic volume streets where through movement of bicycles is given priority over motor vehicles Advisory bike lanes include dashed bike lane striping and single motor vehicle lane. Vehicles are allowed to enter bike lanes to pass each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pedestrian and Bicycle Pathways.</strong> These facilities are outside of the roadway right-of way and fully separated from the roadway.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Street Connections.</strong> New local streets built to City standards. Sidewalks accommodate pedestrian travel and bike travel share the roadway with vehicles.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pedestrian and Bicycle Crossings.</strong> Two types of crossings were identified. The first type is provided by the existing traffic signals. New signals were not recommended. The second crossing type is shown at generally desired locations between signalized intersections. Specific design treatments were not determined (e.g. pedestrian refuge island, HAWK signal, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Potential Street Realignment.</strong> Opportunities to realign existing streets through future redevelopment. The objective is to align intersections on opposite sides of Powell Boulevard to improve pedestrian crossings or access to transit stops.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 id=\"division-midway-neighborhood-street-plan\">Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</h6>\n<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37157 October 15, 2015)</p>\n<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), in partnership with the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed the Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan. The Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan was developed to help improve local street and pathway connectivity in several East Portland neighborhoods. The project area is centered on SE Division Street, a designated &quot;Main Street&quot; in the Metro Region 2040 Growth Concept Plan and the study area was bounded by SE 112th Ave, SE 148th Ave, SE Stark and SE Holgate and includes portions of the Hazelwood, Mill Park, Centennial and Powellhurst Gilbert neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Goals and Objectives: The overall goal is to develop a Neighborhood Street Plan that can better increase street connectivity and multi-modal travel options within the project area. Objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Establish a more connected local street and path network</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create safer walking and bicycling routes to neighborhood destinations, transit and the regionally designated SE Division Main Street</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Define the range of options for improving local streets, including use of Portland Street By Street design options.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inform future improvements to be built over-time by property owners, developers and the City.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Street Plan identified implementation methods for introducing new street and pathway connections and options for improving deficient local streets. The plan recommended adding New Future Public Connections across Existing Private Property.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image13.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h5 id=\"southwest-portland-master-street-plans\">Southwest Portland Master Street Plans</h5>\n<h6 id=\"tryon-stephens-headwaters-neighborhood-street-plan\">Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</h6>\n<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37162, November 2015)</p>\n<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) developed the Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan to create a strategy to complete the transportation network and stormwater system within the study area. The Tryon-Stephens plan provides a strategy for enhancing neighborhood access to local destinations by looking comprehensively at street and drainage issues. The Tryon-Stephens Street Plan sets a framework for tailoring improvements to individual streets based on the adjacent land use, street character, and natural setting.</p>\n<p>The plan recommends modifying the City of Portland&#39;s Southwest Master Street Plan (2001) to add future local street/pathway connections in two locations within the study area, as shown on the following map (page 52 of the Tryon-Stevens plan). Recommended new connections are in the Hillsdale neighborhood linking SW Nevada Court to SW Vermont Street between SW 26th Avenue and Capitol Hill Road, and in the Markham Neighborhood linking SW Marigold Street between SW 23rd and SW 26th Avenues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"areas-not-covered-by-master-street-plans\">Areas not covered by Master Street Plans</h2>\n<p>Master Street plans have not been completed for all or parts of the North, Northeast, Far Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Central City districts. Other areas were excluded from the Southwest and Far Southeast Master Street Plans: the east light rail corridor (102nd to the city limits, NE Glisan to SE Stark), the Hillsdale town center, and the West Portland town center. Master Street plans for these areas will be completed as refinement plans of the TSP. Until such plans are completed, the location and implementation of new street and pedestrian/bicycle connections will be governed by Title 17: Public Improvements, and Title 33: Planning and Zoning, requirements in City Code. Title 17 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that do not include a land division, and Title 33 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that do include a land division. The spacing standards in each title are 530 feet for full street connections and 330 feet for pedestrian/bicycle connections where full street connections are not feasible.</p>\n",

The long-term vision developed identifies and prioritizes opportunities to improve bus service as well as pedestrian and bike access to transit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://news.trimet.org/category/service-enhancement-plans/\">[http://news.trimet.org/category/service-enhancement-plans/]{.underline}</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"growing-transit-communities-plan-gtc\">Growing Transit Communities Plan (GTC)</h3>\n<p>The Growing Transit Communities Plan is an effort to identify and prioritize the most beneficial improvements that would make getting to the bus and using the bus, a safer and more convenient option along sections of 3 bus lines 87, 77, and 20. The purpose of the GTC Plan is to determine a package of transportation investments on a corridor level that would best create transit-oriented neighborhoods, places where transit (along with walking and bicycling for short trips) is truly the mode of choice for getting to and from work, school, shops, or other destinations. Frequent transit service is one essential component of a transit-oriented community, but other components include safe access to transit, bus stop quality, sidewalk and bikeway network connections, crossings of busy streets, and the overall built environment. Deficiencies in these other factors often lead to lower ridership, and make frequent service less viable to implement.</p>\n<p>The Portland Plan and the Climate Action Plan have established a mode split goal of 25% of all trips on transit by 2035, and the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan includes a goal of tripling transit mode share over 2005 levels. Increasing transit service frequency and targeted investments in access to transit are ways to increase transit ridership. Implementation of this Plan will help the City reach these policy goals and accommodate future growth.</p>\n<p>Data from Metro&#39;s 2011 Travel Activity Survey indicates that 6.6% of trips in Portland are currently on transit, increasing only 20% between 1994 and 2011. Additional support for transit is needed, as the current growth trend is not aggressive enough to meet mode share targets and accommodate the transportation needs of expected population and employment growth. The Comprehensive Plan, prioritizes transit-oriented centers and corridors to accommodate expected population and employment growth while minimizing traffic growth. TriMet developed its Service Enhancement Plans to present long-term visions for the future development of the transit system. These two planning efforts combined work together to provide high-frequency and high-capacity transit to areas identified for high-density residential and employment land uses. This coordination results in a concentration of compact, 20-minute neighborhoods where transit is the mode of choice for longer trips to other parts of the City or region.</p>\n<p>Transit and higher density zoning alone are not sufficient to produce the levels of development and transit use to meet regional goals. Without safe pedestrian and bicycle access to transit, high-quality transit stops, fast and reliable transit operations, parking management, and effective demand management, the automobile will likely be the preferred mode. TriMet&#39;s future investment and improving and expanding the frequent transit network will be prioritized based on the level of local access investments, transit-supportive policies, and priority treatments. TriMet and the City will work together to update corridors with transit-supportive investments to help support both frequent transit service and transit-oriented development. Targeted investments in access to transit, stop amenities, transit priority treatments, and demand management are ways to increase transit ridership. This project will help the City reach the adopted Climate Action Plan goal of achieving a 25% transit mode share by 2035. Making early investments before anticipated development will ensure future residents and employees find transit to be an attractive travel choice when they are moving or changing jobs and are most receptive to a change in mode choice. Transit-supportive investments have additional benefits by improving pedestrian and bicycle networks and enhancing transit service used by a wider population than those who work and live along the corridor. These investments will also help corridors meet TriMet&#39;s criteria for frequent service expansion, allowing the City to leverage investments for increased transit service hours.</p>\n<p>For more information please visit <a href=\"https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/68193\">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/68193</a></p>\n<p><strong>Recent Transit Improvements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Streetcar Loop</strong></p>\n<p>Since first opening service from NW 23rd Avenue to Portland State University in 2001, PBOT and Portland Streetcar, Inc. have worked together to continuously fine tune and improve the efficiency and reliability of Portland Streetcar.

Despite consistent investment in the pedestrian network, significant gaps and deficiencies remain, and new policy questions have emerged. An incomplete pedestrian network limits the City&#39;s ability to absorb growth and meet the livability and access needs of residents, including safe walking access to public transit and essential services. The 1998 Pedestrian Master Plan has served inner Portland well, but has often struggled to provide adequate guidance for areas such as East Portland and Southwest Portland that present environmental challenges and right-of-way constraints.</p>\n<p>PedPDX will reflect changes to pedestrian policy and design best practices that have emerged since the original Pedestrian Master Plan was adopted, including an emerging understanding of transportation equity and a <a href=\"https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/40390\">Vision Zero</a> approach to pedestrian safety.

During this process, the City recognized the need to better understand freight-related issues in order to:</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ensure Portland&#39;s transportation network can support the projected increased demand for freight movement.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Balance freight mobility needs with community impacts and other transportation modes (bicycle, pedestrian, transit, auto).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Take advantage of economic opportunities and changes in the global economy by capitalizing on Portland&#39;s inherent geographic advantage and existing multimodal freight transportation system (marine, rail, air, highway, pipeline).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Based on the 2002 Port of Portland Commodity Flow Forecast, demand for freight tonnage into, out of, and within the Portland area will grow from 260 million tons with a total value of $352 billion in 1997 to 522 million tons with a combined value of $827 billion by 2030.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The volume of freight tonnage in the Portland area is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.1%. The overall share of freight tonnage by year 2030 is projected to be: Truck (73%), Rail (11%), Ocean and Barge (10%), Pipeline (6%), and Air (&lt;1%).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What Does the Freight Master Plan Do?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The Freight Master Plan is part of the City&#39;s Comprehensive Plan - the policy guide for City growth and development - and one of the modal elements of the City&#39;s Transportation System Plan, which elevates freight to the same level as the other modal plans (bicycle, pedestrian, motor vehicle, transportation demand management, transit) by addressing the unique characteristics, needs and impacts of freight movement.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n\n<ul>\n<li>Established the Portland Freight Committee, which brought together a diverse group of members representing various multi-modal freight service providers, shippers, trade associations, and businesses involved in freight activities as well as public agency representatives from the local, state, and federal levels. The Portland Freight Committee serves as an advisory group to the Mayor, Portland City Council and the Portland Bureau of Transportation on freight related issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How is the Freight Master Plan Implemented?</strong> The capital projects, programs and activities identified in Freight Master Plan were developed based on three core values:</p>\n<p><strong>Fact Sheet: Portland Freight Master Plan</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/357102\">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/357102</a></p>\n<p><strong>Other Freight Planning, Projects and Programs</strong></p>\n<p><strong>St John&#39;s Transportation Concept Plan</strong></p>\n<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), in partnership with the Portland Bureau of Planning<br>and Sustainability, Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, Port of Portland, Metro, TriMet, and the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), has developed a set of location‐specific and programmatic recommendations to address traffic circulation, freight mobility, and pedestrian access issues identified in the St. Johns Truck Strategy.

Words and terms in the Glossary have the specific meaning stated below when used in the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, unless the context clearly indicates another meaning. Words not included in this Glossary are defined by their dictionary meaning, or in some cases, by their meaning in state or federal law.</p>\n<p><strong>2040 Growth Concept</strong></p>\n<p>A concept for the long-term growth management of our region, developed by Metro. It describes the preferred form of regional growth, including where growth should be clustered, what the appropriate densities are for various land use design types, and which areas should be protected as open space. The 2040 Growth Concept was adopted as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong></p>\n<p>The ability to approach or make use of transportation facilities, parks and open space, public infrastructure, or businesses and services that are open to the public. Good access means within close proximity (up to ó mile) that is free from physical barriers for those with limited mobility.</p>\n<p><strong>Access Management</strong></p>\n<p>Measures regulating access to streets, roads, and highways from public roads and private driveways. Measures may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the siting of interchanges, restrictions on the type and amount of access to roadways, and use of physical controls (such as signals and channelization, including raised medians) to reduce impacts of approach road traffic on the main facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>\n<p>The ability to move easily from one mode of transportation to another mode or to a destination. Accessibility increases when the number and quality of travel choices increases. Accessibility is affected by the mix of land uses and the travel alternatives available.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessway</strong></p>\n<p>A type of right-of-way, either public or private, that is primarily to provide pedestrian and bicycle linkages consistent with connectivity needs, but may be used for vehicle access to parking or for emergency vehicles. Accessways are typically short in length and are used where full street connections are not needed and/or are not physically feasible.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Transportation</strong></p>\n<p>Transportation that involves physical activity, including walking, biking and using transit.</p>\n<p><strong>Activity Center</strong></p>\n<p>A cluster of uses that collectively generates many trips (e.g., school and park, neighborhood commercial district). An activity center can be a single use that generates many trips (e.g., stadium, large commercial outlet, large institution).</p>\n<p><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</strong></p>\n<p>Civil rights legislation enacted by Congress that mandates the development of a plan to address discrimination and equal opportunity for disabled persons in employment, transportation, public accommodation, public services, and telecommunications.</p>\n<p><strong>Area Permit Parking Program</strong></p>\n<p>A Portland Bureau of Transportation program to ensure that on-street parking associated with commercial, industrial, institutional development or large events will not spill over into adjacent residential neighborhoods. The program allows residents and firms a limited supply of permits for on-street parking and restricts on-street parking for other potential users.</p>\n<p><strong>Arterial</strong></p>\n<p>Any street that is not a Local Service Traffic Street according to the traffic classification maps in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Arterials include Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, Neighborhood Collectors, and Traffic Access Streets.</p>\n<p><em>Also:</em> A class of street. Arterial streets interconnect and support the throughway system. Arterials are intended to provide general mobility for travel within the region. Correctly sized arterials at appropriate intervals allow through trips to remain on the arterial system thereby discouraging use of local streets for cut-through travel. Arterial streets link major commercial, residential, industrial and institutional areas. Major arterials serve longer distance through trips and serve more of a regional traffic function. Minor arterials serve shorter, more localized travel within a community. As a result, major arterials usually carry more traffic than minor arterials. Arterial streets are usually spaced about one mile apart and are designed to accommodate bicycle, pedestrian, truck and transit travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Attractor</strong></p>\n<p>A use that, by its nature, draws large numbers of people to it for special events or regular activities. Regional attractors include uses such as sports arenas and convention centers.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Oriented Development</strong></p>\n<p>Development that is either: 1) auto-related (such as gas stations and auto repair shops) or 2) auto-accommodating (by its design attracts primarily customers and employees arriving by automobile, such as drive-in restaurants).</p>\n<p><strong>Benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>A specific target or goal to be achieved in a specific timeframe. Benchmarks are used to determine the attainment of performance indicators and performance measures (defined below).</p>\n<p><strong>Bicycle</strong></p>\n<p>A vehicle having two tandem wheels, a minimum of 14 inches in diameter, propelled by human power, upon which a person or persons may ride. A three-wheeled adult tricycle is considered a bicycle. In Oregon, a bicycle is legally defined as a vehicle. Bicyclists have the same right to the roadways and must obey the same traffic laws as the operators of other vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Bicycle Boulevard</strong></p>\n<p>See Neighborhood Greenway.</p>\n<p><strong>Bicyclist</strong></p>\n<p>Person riding a bicycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Bike Share</strong></p>\n<p>Bike Share is an innovative transportation program that provides users access to bicycles on a short-term basis for one-way travel within a designated service area.</p>\n<p><strong>Carpool</strong></p>\n<p>A motor vehicle carrying two or three (depending on the context) or more people, usually commuting on a regular or semi-regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Car Sharing</strong></p>\n<p>An organization consisting of a group of individuals who share a fleet of cars. The purchase or lease of vehicles, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs is borne by the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Centers</strong></p>\n<p>Places with concentrations of commercial and community services, housing, gathering places, and transit connections. Centers provide services to surrounding neighborhoods and are intended to be enhanced as places because they are a focus of housing and job growth. There are four types of centers with varying functions, levels of activity, and scales and intensities of development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Central City: Corresponds to the Central City plan district, which serves as the region&#39;s premier center, anchoring an interconnected system of centers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Gateway Regional Center: Corresponds to the Gateway plan district, East Portland&#39;s largest center, which is intended to be enhanced as an employment and community service hub within the area and region.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Town Centers: Large centers that serve a broad area of the city and have an important role in accommodating growth. They provide a full range of commercial and community services, high-density housing, mid-rise commercial and mid-rise mixed-use buildings (typically up to five to seven stories in height), are served by high-capacity transit connections, and have a substantial employment component. Town Centers provide housing opportunities for enough population to support a full-service business district.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Neighborhood Centers: Centers that primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods and provide opportunities for additional housing and low- to mid-rise commercial and mixed-use buildings (typically up to three to five stories in height). They provide a range of local commercial and community services and transit connections. Neighborhood Centers provide housing opportunities for about half the population needed to support a neighborhood business district.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>City Greenway</strong></p>\n<p>A system of distinctive pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly green streets and trails, enhanced by lush tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that support active living by expanding transportation and recreational opportunities and making it easier and more attractive to reach destinations across the city. City Greenways are a network that includes the following types of infrastructure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Enhanced greenway corridors are distinctive green streets with extensive tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that provide connections between major centers, schools, parks, natural areas, and the rivers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Trails are often located along rivers or through natural areas, providing pedestrian and bicycle connections.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Heritage parkways are iconic streets or segments of streets with elements such as linear parkways, scenic views, and distinctive landscaping or street design.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles and enhanced for pedestrians, working in conjunction with the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into all neighborhoods.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Collector of Regional Significance</strong></p>\n<p>As designated in the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan, a route that connects the regional arterial system and the local system by collecting and distributing neighborhood traffic to arterial streets. Collectors of regional significance have three purposes: 1) They ensure adequate access to the primary and secondary land use components of the 2040 Growth Concept; 2) They allow dispersion of arterial traffic over a number of lesser facilities where an adequate local network exists; 3) They help define appropriate collector level movement between jurisdictions. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>\n<p><strong>Collector Street</strong></p>\n<p>A class of street. Collector streets provide both access and circulation between residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural community areas and the arterial system. As such, collectors tend to carry fewer motor vehicles than arterial streets, with reduced travel speeds. Collector streets are usually spaced at half-mile intervals, midway between arterial streets. Collectors may serve as bike, pedestrian and freight access routes, providing local connections to the arterial street network and transit system. While the focus for collectors has been on motor vehicle traffic, they are developed as multi-modal facilities that accommodate bicycles, pedestrians and transit.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete Streets</strong></p>\n<p>Complete streets provide accessibility to all users of the right-of-way regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation. They are designed and operated to make better places and to enhance safe access for all modes, including people walking and bicycling, those using a mobility device, motorists, and transit users.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Uses</strong></p>\n<p>Community uses in the right of way include but are not limited to temporary uses such as public gathering spaces, events, food production or temporary festivals, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Congestion</strong></p>\n<p>A condition characterized by unstable traffic flows that prevents reliable movement on a transportation facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Connected Vehicle</strong></p>\n<p>A vehicle that communicates with the Internet, other vehicles, wayside systems and/or passengers.</p>\n<p><strong>Corridor</strong></p>\n<p>1. Corridors (2040 design type) -- A type of land use that is typically located along regional transit routes and arterial streets, providing a place for somewhat higher densities than is found in 2040 centers. These land uses should feature a high-quality pedestrian environment and convenient access to transit. Typical new developments would include rowhouses, duplexes and one to three-story office and retail buildings, and average about 25 persons per acre. While some corridors may be continuous, narrow bands of higher-intensity development along arterial streets, others may be more nodal, that is a series of smaller centers at major intersections or other locations along the arterial that have high quality pedestrian environments, good connection to adjacent neighborhoods and transit service.</p>\n<p>2. Corridor as defined in the Comprehensive Plan is an area that may be a single major street, or a broad mobility corridor that provides connections for a range of transportation modes (transit, pedestrians, cyclists, freight, motor vehicles, and so forth), not necessarily on the same street. There are three types of corridor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Civic Corridor: These are a prioritized subset of the city&#39;s most prominent transit and transportation streets. They connect centers, provide regional connections, and include segments where commercial development and housing are focused. Civic Corridors are intended to continue their important transportation functions while providing livable environments for people, and evolving into distinctive places that are models of ecological design.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Neighborhood Corridor: Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Freight Corridor: Primary routes into and through the city that support Portland as an important West Coast hub and a gateway for international and domestic trade. These facilities are integral to the growth of traded sector businesses such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution industries.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Curb Zone</strong></p>\n<p>The area of public right-of-way adjacent to the curb that can be used for a wide variety of mobility and access functions, including but not limited to vehicle lanes, bike lanes, curb extensions, transit platforms, street trees, loading zones, on-street parking, bike corrals, and street seats.</p>\n<p><strong>Early Bird Parking</strong></p>\n<p>Parking that is provided to encourage its use primarily by commuters. Typically, the pricing strategy is to offer a lower all-day rate if the parker arrives before a certain time in the morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Electric Vehicle</strong></p>\n<p>An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, is a vehicle which uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Depending on the type of vehicle, motion may be provided by wheels or propellers driven by rotary motors, or in the case of tracked vehicles, by linear motors.</p>\n<p><strong>Emergency Response Vehicles</strong></p>\n<p>Vehicles employed in responding to emergencies. Examples of emergency response vehicles include fire apparatus, ambulances, and police cars.</p>\n<p><strong>Employer Commute Options (ECO)</strong></p>\n<p>DEQ ECO program required employers with more than 100 employees to provide commute options to employees designed to reduce the number of cars driven to work in Portland and surrounding areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Impact Statement</strong></p>\n<p>An environmental assessment required by the National Environmental Protection Act for &quot;any major Federal action that may significantly affect the environment.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Faves</strong></p>\n<p>Fleet, fully Automated Vehicles that are Electric and Shared.</p>\n<p><strong>Freight</strong></p>\n<p>Raw and bulk materials and products that require value-adding or warehousing.</p>\n<p><strong>Freight Intermodal Facility</strong></p>\n<p>An intercity facility where freight is transferred between two or more modes (e.g., truck to rail, rail to ship, truck to air, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Frequent Service (Trimet)</strong></p>\n<p>Bus or MAX Light Rail transit service that runs every 15 minutes or better most of the day, every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional Plan</strong></p>\n<p>A limited-purpose, multijurisdictional plan for an area or activity having significant districtwide impact on the orderly and responsible development of the metropolitan area. A Functional Plan serves as a guideline for local comprehensive plans consistent with ORS 268.390.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>\n<p>The broadest expressions of a community&#39;s desires. Goals give direction and are concerned with the long term; they often describe ideal situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Goods</strong></p>\n<p>Finished products, commodities, and wares ready for the final consumer.</p>\n<p><strong>Green Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Public or private assets --- either natural resources or engineered green facilities --- that protect, support, or mimic natural systems to provide stormwater management, water quality, public health and safety, open space, and other complementary ecosystem services. Examples include trees, ecoroofs, green street facilities, wetlands, and natural waterways.</p>\n<p><strong>Green Street</strong></p>\n<p>A green street is a street with a landscaped street-side planter or bioswale that captures stormwater runoff from the street and allows it to soak into the ground as soil and vegetation filter out pollutants. A green street is not the same as a City Greenway, though a City Greenway may include green street elements.</p>\n<p><strong>High-capacity Transit</strong></p>\n<p>High-capacity transit is public transit that bypasses congestion by making full or partial use of exclusive right of way, a non-exclusive right of way, using transit priority or a combination of both. Vehicles make fewer stops, travel at higher speeds, have more frequent service, and carry more people than local service transit such as typical bus lines. High-capacity transit can be provided by a variety of vehicle types including light rail, commuter rail, streetcar, and bus.</p>\n<p><strong>High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)</strong></p>\n<p>Any vehicle carrying two or more persons, including the driver. An HOV could be a transit bus, vanpool, carpool, or any other vehicle that meets the minimum occupancy requirements. Consistent with federal regulations, motorcycles (with or without passengers) are considered HOVs.</p>\n<p><strong>Historically Marginalized Communities</strong></p>\n<p>Communities included as part of the 2018 RTP Transportation Equity Assessment include: People of Color; People with Lower-Incomes; People with Limited English Proficiency; Older Adults; Young Persons</p>\n<p><strong>Home-Based Work Trip Attractions</strong></p>\n<p>The trips made by commuters from their homes to their places of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Necessary municipal or public services, provided by the government or by private companies and defined as long-lived capital assets that normally are stationary and can be preserved for a significant number of years. Examples are streets, bridges, tunnels, drainage systems, water and sewer lines, parks, pump stations and treatment plants, dams, and lighting systems. Beyond transportation and utility networks, Portland includes buildings, green infrastructure, communications, and information technology as necessary infrastructure investments that serve the community. See also Public facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)</strong></p>\n<p>The application of a broad range of commutations-based information, control and electronics technologies to improve the efficiency and safety of the transportation systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Local Improvement District (LID)</strong></p>\n<p>A method that allows a group of property owners to share the cost and benefits of public improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Locally Preferred Alternative</strong></p>\n<p>The option selected by local jurisdiction(s) following completion of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS).</p>\n<p><strong>Main Street</strong></p>\n<p>Neighborhood shopping areas along an arterial street or at an intersection that have a unique character that draws people from outside the adjacent neighborhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Metro</strong></p>\n<p>The regional government and designated metropolitan planning organization (MPO) of the Portland region. It is governed by a seven-member elected Metro Council and is responsible for regional transportation planning activities, such as the preparation of the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan and the planning of regional transportation projects, including light rail.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed-Use Areas</strong></p>\n<p>Compact areas of development that include a mix of uses, either within buildings or among buildings, and include residential development as one of the potential components.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobility Zone</strong></p>\n<p>The area of the right-of-way used primarily for people and/or goods movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA)</strong></p>\n<p>The Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA) is an ODOT designation applied by local governments to downtowns, town centers, main streets or other areas inside Urban Growth Boundaries where the local government determines there is: high quality connectivity to and within the area by modes of transportation other than the automobile; a denser level of development of a variety of commercial and residential uses than the surrounding areas; a desire to encourage these characteristics through development standards and an understanding that increased automobile congestion within and around the MMA is accepted as a potential trade-off.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobility</strong></p>\n<p>The ability to move people and goods from place to place, or the potential for movement. Mobility improves when the transportation network is refined or expanded to improve capacity of one or more modes, allowing people and goods to move more quickly toward a destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Mode Split</strong></p>\n<p>The percentage of trips taken by each of the possible modes of travel (motor vehicle, transit, bicycle, walk). Mode split does not refer to the number of trips. For example, the number of trips by a particular mode may increase, but the percentage of trips by that mode may stay the same or be reduced if there is also growth in the overall number of trips for other modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Motor Vehicle Level-of-Service (LOS)</strong></p>\n<p>A qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream. A level-of-service definition generally describes these conditions in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience, and safety. LOS ratings of &#39;A&#39; through &#39;F&#39; describe the traffic flow characteristics on streets and highways and at intersections, as shown on the following table:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Multimodal</strong></p>\n<p>Having a variety of modes available for any given trip, such as being able to walk, ride a bicycle, take a bus, or drive to a certain destination. In a transportation system, multimodal means providing for many modes within a single transportation corridor.</p>\n<p><strong>National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs)</strong></p>\n<p>Air quality standards for a variety of pollutants.</p>\n<p><strong>Neighborhood</strong></p>\n<p>For the TSP classification system, a neighborhood is an area bounded by Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and/or Neighborhood Collectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Neighborhood Greenway</strong></p>\n<p>Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles and enhanced for pedestrians, working in conjunction with the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into all neighborhoods.</p>\n<p><strong>Neighborhood Corridor</strong></p>\n<p>Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\n<p>These are specific statements that carry out a plan in the short term. Objectives help assess incremental progress toward achieving the broader purposes expressed in goals and policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Obstruction</strong></p>\n<p>Something that hinders from passage, action, or operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT)</strong></p>\n<p>State agency that oversees and maintains the State highway system, under the guidance of the Oregon Transportation Commission.</p>\n<p><strong>Oregon&#39;s Statewide Planning Goals</strong></p>\n<p>The 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State&#39;s land use planning program. The 19 goals can be grouped into four broad categories: land use, resource management, economic development, and citizen involvement. Locally adopted comprehensive plans and regional transportation plans must be consistent with the statewide planning goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Paratransit</strong></p>\n<p>On-demand non-fixed route service that serves special transit markets, including disabled populations unable to use regular transit service. Other examples include demand-responsive (e.g., dial-a-ride) and contracted fixed-route service.</p>\n<p><strong>Park-and-Ride Facility</strong></p>\n<p>A parking lot or structure in association with a light rail station, transit stop, or transit transfer point. Generally, park-and-rides should provide access to regional route service for areas not directly served by transit. Bicycle and pedestrian access, as well as parking and storage for bicycles, should be considered in locating new park-and-ride facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Pattern Areas</strong></p>\n<p>Five primary geographies in Portland that have differing physical characteristics, needs, and assets. Each of these areas has unique topographies and natural features, patterns and types of development, street and other infrastructure characteristics, and histories that have shaped their urban form.
