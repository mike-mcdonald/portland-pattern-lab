      "content": "<p>Portland is projected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new residents over the next 20 years. As Portland and the region grow, however, there is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of people who drive alone to work remains the same as it is now (nearly 60 percent), traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>supporting the City&#39;s commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our transportation system</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move more reliably</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>creating great places</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active transportation modes is essential to preserving the City&#39;s livability and for the protection of the natural environment. Constructing significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is not a viable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land, encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts. Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>\n<p>The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City&#39;s 2035 Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region&#39;s 2040 Growth Concept by supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help grow and sustain the City&#39;s economic health by accommodating the needs of businesses and supporting Portland&#39;s role in the international economy.</p>\n<p><strong>The 2035 TSP includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and implementation of Portland&#39;s transportation system</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan that would accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Master street plans and modal plans</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street classifications</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"elements-of-the-tsp\">Elements of the TSP</h2>\n<p>The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP were adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan by City Council in 2016. The TSP was adopted concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover. Stage 3 Update will be adopted separately from the Comp Plan and Stages 1 and 2, then incorporated into one TSP document.</p>\n<p>The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City&#39;s Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about transportation system conditions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/media/image2.png\" alt=\"Relation to Other Plans_updated 10_03_14.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"transportation-system-plan-updates\">Transportation System Plan Updates</h2>\n<p>In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at regular intervals. The first two updates in the mid-2000s were not intended to include new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of planning efforts.</p>\n<p>The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).</p>\n<p>The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to implement the City&#39;s Green Street Policy.</p>\n<p>Stage 1 TSP Update was a part of the City&#39;s Comprehensive Plan update process and a component of the state&#39;s Periodic Work Plan Task 4. It included Goals, Policies, Projects and Programs and a Financial Plan. It was adopted by City Council in June 2016.</p>\n<p>The Stage 2 TSP Update was a part of the City&#39;s Comprehensive Plan update and changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. Periodic Work Plan Task 5 was adopted by City Council in December 2016.</p>\n<p>TSP Stage 3 TSP Update is incorporating regional information, updating geographic policies and objectives, updating objectives, adding a few policies, changes to street classification for traffic, transit and emergency response, modal plans, and other changes as identified. There is also parallel staff process to reformat the document and create a new user friendly digital document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"regulatory-framework\">Regulatory Framework</h2>\n<p>The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.</p>\n<p>State of Oregon</p>\n<p><em>Statewide Planning Goals</em></p>\n<p>Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State&#39;s land use planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals. The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>\n<p><em>Transportation Planning Rule</em></p>\n<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>\n<p><em>Oregon Transportation Plan</em></p>\n<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State&#39;s TSP. Regional and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.</p>\n<p>Regional Metro</p>\n<p><em>Regional Transportation Plan</em></p>\n<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Focuses on the regional transportation system</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design classifications</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes a list of major system improvements</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Includes a funding plan</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of August 2017 Metro and regional partners are updating the RTP with a new RTP to be issued in 2018.</p>\n<p><em>Region 2040 Growth Concept</em></p>\n<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development, including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space protection. It also designates design types, such as central city, regional center, town center, and main street.</p>\n<p><em>Regional Transportation Functional Plan</em></p>\n<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>\n<p><em>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</em></p>\n<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in 1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>\n<p><em>Regional Framework Plan</em></p>\n<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>\n<p>City of Portland</p>\n<p><em>Comprehensive Plan</em></p>\n<p>Portland&#39;s 2035 Comprehensive Plan guides land use development and public facility investment decisions between now and 2035. This guidance is intended to help make Portland more prosperous, healthy, equitable and resilient.</p>\n<p>The Comprehensive Plan includes five elements that work together to accomplish this goal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Vision and Guiding Principles</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Goals and Policies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Comprehensive Plan Map</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>List of Significant Projects</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transportation policies, classifications and master street plans</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Within the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, there are nine Transportation goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Safety</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Multiple goals</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Great places</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Environmentally sustainable</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Equitable transportation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Positive health outcomes</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Opportunities for prosperity</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Cost effectiveness</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Airport futures</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Transportation related policies from the 2035 Comprehensive Plan (2015) are located in Chapter 9 (Transportation), Chapter 3 (Urban Design), Chapter 4 (Development) and Chapter 8 (Public Facilities). The TSP also includes additional sub-policies and geographic-specific policies and objectives.</p>\n<p>Chapter 9: Transportation (policies are grouped in these subject areas:)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Designing and planning</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Land use, development, and placemaking</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Streets as public spaces</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Modal Policies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Airport Futures</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>System Management</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transportation Demand Management</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Parking Management</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finance, Programs and Coordination</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 8: Public Facilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Funding</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Public Benefits</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Public Rights of Way</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Trails</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Stormwater systems</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 3: Urban Form</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Citywide design and development</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Centers</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Corridors</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transit Station Areas</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>City Greenways</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Employment areas</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Pattern Areas</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 4: Development</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Design and Development of centers and corridors</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Designing with nature</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation also using Comprehensive Plan Chapter 2: Community Involvement for its public involvement policies.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 has seven goals and 41 policies.</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Community Involvement as a Partnership</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Social Justice and Equity</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Value Community Wisdom and Participation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transparency and Accountability</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Meaningful Participation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Accessible and Effective Participation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Strong Civic Infrastructure</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter 2 policies are grouped in these major areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Partners in decision making</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Environmental justice</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Invest in education and training</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Community assessment</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transparency and accountability</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Community involvement program</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Process design and evaluation</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Information design and development</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"seven-outcomes\">Seven Outcomes</h2>\n<p>Working with our partners at Metro, the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, and the Oregon Department of Transportation, with direction from the Portland Plan (2012), the Climate Action Plan (2010), Health Equity &amp; the Transportation System Plan Report (2012), and from the Comprehensive Plan Update, PBOT staff developed an outcome based approach to the TSP.</p>\n<p>These seven outcomes directed policy choices as well as informed the development of criteria for selecting and prioritizing TSP Projects and Programs.

See the update of the Pedestrian Master Plan at <a href=\"https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/72504\">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/72504</a>)</em></p></h2>\n<p>Pedestrian Classification Descriptions maintain a system of pedestrianways to serve all types of pedestrian trips, particularly those with a transportation function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pedestrian-districts\">Pedestrian Districts</h3>\n<p>Pedestrian Districts are intended to give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, and station communities.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive pedestrian activity. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high levels of pedestrian activity may be included in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a strong pedestrian orientation.</p>\n<p><strong>Streets within a District:</strong> Make walking the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are equal in importance in serving pedestrian trips and should have sidewalks on both sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafficway itself is not.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to transit stops.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design streets within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may include widened sidewalks, curb extensions, street lighting, street trees, and signing. Where two arterials cross, design treatments such as curb extensions, median pedestrian refuges, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals should be considered to minimize the crossing distance, direct pedestrians across the safest route, and provide safe gaps in the traffic stream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"pedestrian-transit-streets\">Pedestrian-Transit Streets</h3>\n<p>Pedestrian-Transit Streets are intended to create a strong and visible relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Pedestrian-Transit Streets respond to significant public investments in public transportation, including light rail, the transit mall, and streetcar, and enhance the pedestrian environment adjacent to high-density land uses.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Improvements should include wide sidewalks to accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and transit vehicles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"city-walkways\">City Walkways</h3>\n<p>City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access to activities along major streets and to recreation and institutions; provide connections between neighborhoods; and provide access to transit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Walkways should serve areas with dense zoning, commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design City Walkways. Consider special design treatment for City Walkways that are also designated as Regional or Community Main Streets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"off-street-paths\">Off-Street Paths</h3>\n<p>Off-Street Paths are intended to serve recreational and other walking trips.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong> Use Off-Street Paths as shortcuts to link urban destinations and origins along continuous greenbelts such as rivers, park and forest areas, and other scenic corridors, and used as elements of a regional, citywide, or community recreational trail plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Establish Off-Street Paths in corridors not well served by the street system. On existing rights-of-way that are not developed or likely to be developed in the near future, Off-Street Paths may be designated where needed to complete the pedestrian system.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as separated facilities that accommodate pedestrians and may accommodate other non-motorized vehicles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"local-service-walkways\">Local Service Walkways</h3>\n<p>Local Service Walkways are intended to serve local circulation needs for pedestrians and provide safe and convenient access to local destinations, including safe routes to schools.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Local Service Walkways are usually located in residential, commercial, or industrial areas on Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>\n<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as City Walkways or Off-Street Paths, with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Walkways.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Local Service Walkways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"bicycle-classification-descriptions\">Bicycle Classification Descriptions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"major-city-bikeways\">Major City Bikeways</h3>\n<p>Major City Bikeways form the backbone of the city&#39;s bikeway network and are intended to serve high volumes of bicycle traffic and provide direct, seamless, efficient travel across and between transportation districts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Major City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Major City Bikeways should be designed to accommodate large volumes of bicyclists, to maximize their comfort and to minimize delays by emphasizing the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on Major City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after performing careful analysis to determine potential impacts to the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On Major City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines. Where conditions warrant and where practical, Major City Bikeways should have separated facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>###</p>\n<h3 id=\"city-bikeways\">City Bikeways</h3>\n<p>City Bikeways are intended to establish direct and convenient bicycle access to significant destinations, to provide convenient access to Major City Bikeways and to provide coverage within three city blocks of any given point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types and residential neighborhoods.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> City Bikeways emphasize the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after taking into consideration the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"local-service-bikeways\">Local Service Bikeways</h3>\n<p>Local Service Bikeways are intended to serve local circulation needs for bicyclists and provide access to adjacent properties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as City Bikeways or Major City Bikeways with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Bikeways.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Consider the following design treatments for Local Service Bikeways: shared roadways, traffic calming, bicycle lanes, and extra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with other rights-of-way should minimize conflicts.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking on Local Service Bikeways should not be removed to provide bicycle lanes.</p>\n<p><strong>Operation:</strong> Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a side effect of creating, accommodating, or encouraging automobile through-traffic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"bicycle-districts\">Bicycle Districts</h3>\n<p>Bicycle Districts are areas with a dense concentration of commercial, cultural, institutional and/or recreational destinations where the City intends to make bicycle travel more attractive than driving.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> High density and mixed-use neighborhoods should be targeted as bicycle districts. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Bicycle Districts.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Bicycle District should be consistent with the scale of bicycling trips. A Bicycle District includes the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> All streets within a Bicycle District are important in serving bicycle trips. Appropriate bicycle facilities should be determined for each street based on the desired bicycling conditions and operations. Use the bikeway design and engineering guidelines to design streets within Bicycle Districts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"transit-classification-descriptions\">Transit Classification Descriptions</h2>\n<p>Maintain a system of transit streets that supports the movement of transit vehicles for regional, interdistrict, and local trips.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regional-transitways\">Regional Transitways</h3>\n<p>Regional Transitways are intended to facilitate regional and interdistrict transit trips with fast and reliable service over long distances, operating in right-of-way exclusively reserved for transit use to the extent possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional Transitway stations to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities closest to the stations.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Transit stations should be designed to accommodate a high level of safe multimodal access within a half-mile radius of the station. Provide convenient connection opportunities at Regional Transitway stations when feasible, including feeder bus service, bike-share stations, secure bicycle parking, pick-up and drop-off zones, and shuttle services. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate fast and reliable transit operations. Provide signal preemption or transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stations or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Provide exclusive or semi-exclusive transitways wherever possible, including treatments on freeways and expressways such as transit lanes, HOV lanes, HOT lanes, and &quot;bus on shoulder&quot; operations. Employ access management measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles. Right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit. Carefully consider any street design changes to Regional Transitways that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Transit Stations:</strong> Locate Regional Transitway stations at intervals of approximately one-half mile to two miles, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points, and people with disabilities. Express or limited service may have stations located further apart, as appropriate to serve origins and destinations. Transit stations should have a full range of passenger services, including accessible boarding platforms, covered waiting areas, route information, benches, secure bicycle parking, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.<br><br><strong>Bus stops:</strong> Buses providing local service along Regional Transitways should have more frequent stop spacing, similar to stop spacing along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>\n<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with a dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major Transit Priority Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> A ramp that connects to a Regional Transitway is classified as a Regional Transitway up to its intersection with a lower-classified street.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"major-transit-priority-streets\">Major Transit Priority Streets</h3>\n<p>Major Transit Priority Streets facilitate the frequent and reliable movement of transit vehicles that connect Central City, regional centers, and town centers with each other and to other major destinations.

Safety countermeasures should be employed on Regional Trafficways to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Regional Trafficways should serve the Central City, regional centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities and should connect key freight routes within the region to points outside the region.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Regional Trafficways should connect to other Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, and District Collectors. A ramp that connects to a Regional Trafficway is classified as a Regional Trafficway from its point of connection up to its intersection with a lower-classified street. At ramps and along access streets, accommodate safe multimodal movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Buffering:</strong> Adjacent neighborhoods should be buffered from the impacts of Regional Trafficways.</p>\n<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with dual Regional Trafficway and Major City Traffic Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major City Traffic Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"major-city-traffic-streets\">Major City Traffic Streets</h3>\n<p>Major City Traffic Streets are intended to serve as the principal routes for interdistrict traffic that has at least one trip end within a City of Portland transportation district.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Major City Traffic Streets. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Major City Traffic Streets to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes for all modes. Major City Traffic Streets should provide separation between motor vehicles and people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices, and provide safe multimodal crossings to destinations.</p>\n<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should provide motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers, town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City Traffic Streets, except within designated centers, main streets, station areas, and other areas with high pedestrian demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a City of Portland transportation district should be discouraged from using Major City Traffic Streets. Where a Major City Traffic Street intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>\n<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking may be removed and additional right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when consistent with the street design designation of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making changes to the roadway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"traffic-access-streets\">Traffic Access Streets</h3>\n<p>Traffic Access Streets are intended to provide access to Central City destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City sub-district, provide connections between Central City subdistricts, and distribute traffic from Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Traffic Access Streets. Traffic Access Streets should provide frequent, safe crossings for people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Traffic Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Traffic management on Traffic Access Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the Central City.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Connections to adjoining transportation districts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Traffic Access Streets and other streets with higher or similar classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning movements from one street to the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses; accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to off-street parking is allowed and encouraged to be located on Traffic Access Streets.</p>\n<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Traffic Access Streets, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"district-collectors\">District Collectors</h3>\n<p>District Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower classification or to serve trips that both start and end within a district.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on District Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be employed to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> District Collectors generally connect town centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that attract trips from the surrounding neighbor­hoods or from throughout the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors. Regional attractors of traffic such as major shopping centers or arenas should be discouraged from locating on District Collectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> District Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where necessary, to Regional Trafficways. Where a District Collector intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>\n<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"neighborhood-collectors\">Neighborhood Collectors</h3>\n<p>Neighborhood Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets or District Collectors to Local Service Streets or to serve trips that both start and end within areas bounded by Major City Traffic Streets and District Collectors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Neighborhood Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be implemented on Neighborhood Collectors to address identified safety risks. Neighborhood Collectors should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect neighborhoods to nearby centers, corridors, station communities, main streets, and other nearby destinations. New land uses and major expansions of land uses that attract a significant volume of traffic from outside the neighborhood should be discour­aged from locating on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets. Where a Neighborhood Collector intersects with a higher-classified street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>\n<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability, when consistent with other street classifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong> The design of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their length as the land use character changes from primarily commercial to primarily residential. All Neighborhood Collectors should be designed to operate as neighborhood streets and through traffic should be discouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"local-service-traffic-streets\">Local Service Traffic Streets</h3>\n<p>Local Service Traffic Streets are intended to distribute local traffic and provide access to local residences or commercial uses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Discourage auto-oriented land uses from using Local Service Traffic Streets as their primary access.</p>\n<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Streets that allow motor vehicles and are not classified as Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, Traffic Access Streets<strong>,</strong> District Collectors, or Neighborhood Collectors are classified as Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should connect neighborhoods, provide local circulation, and provide access to nearby centers, corridors, station areas, and main streets. Street segments may be closed to through traffic in some cases as long as local access and overall neighborhood connectivity is maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability or if needed to support a neighborhood greenway.</p>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets provide local access and circulation for traffic, while often functioning as through routes for pedestrians and bicyclists. In some instances where vehicle speeds and volumes are very low, Local Service Traffic Streets may accommodate vehicles<strong>,</strong> pedestrians<strong>,</strong> and bicyclists in a shared space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"
